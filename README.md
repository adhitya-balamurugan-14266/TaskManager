# TaskManager

A full-stack task management application built on **Zoho Catalyst** — manage services, track tasks with due dates, reminders, pipeline queues, and priorities. View everything in a Kanban-style workspace dashboard with dark mode support.

**Live URL:** https://task-manager.onslate.in

---

## Features

### Services
- Organise tasks under named services (e.g. Engineering, Marketing).
- Each service supports an optional logo stored in Catalyst Stratus.
- Service tiles show **active task count**, **priority task count** (red badge), and **overdue task count** at a glance.
- Clicking anywhere on a service tile opens that service's task view.

### Tasks
- Create tasks with a title, description, due date/time, and optional email reminder.
- Edit tasks inline; complete tasks with an optional **Final Thoughts** note.
- Tasks display a **Priority** badge and red highlight when marked as priority.
- Active and overdue tasks are sorted: **priority tasks first**, then soonest due date.

### Priority System
- Mark any active task as priority via the 🔥 Prioritize button (deprioritize with the same toggle).
- Priority tasks float to the top of every list and kanban column.
- Service tiles show a separate red priority count badge.

### Pipeline
- Create tasks directly in a **Pipeline** (backlog) queue — no due date required.
- Move any active or completed task to the pipeline at any time with an optional **reason** note.
- Activate a pipeline task when ready: assign a due date and optional reminder.
- Edit pipeline tasks (title, description, pipeline reason) inline.
- Pipeline reason is shown in a violet callout on each pipeline card.

### Final Thoughts
- Optionally add a **Final Thoughts** note when completing a task.
- View, add, or edit the note on completed task cards.
- Final thoughts are displayed in a green callout.

### Reminders
- Schedule one-time email reminders via Catalyst Job Scheduling (Cron).
- Reminders fire at the exact due date/time.
- Crons are automatically cancelled when a task is pushed to pipeline or deleted.

### Overdue Tracking
- Tasks past their due date are automatically surfaced in an **Overdue** tab per service and in the global Workspace dashboard.

### My Workspace (Kanban Dashboard)
- Four-column Kanban board: **Pipeline**, **Active**, **Completed**, **Overdue** — all tasks across all services in one view.
- Search bar in the header filters all four columns live as you type.
- Click any card for full task details in a side sheet.
- Jump to any service directly via the ⋯ meatball menu.

### Search
- **Service detail view** — search bar above tabs filters the active, overdue, pipeline, and completed task lists by title or description.
- **Workspace / Kanban** — search bar in the sticky header filters all four columns simultaneously.

### Dark / Light Mode
- Toggle between dark and light themes via the **Sun/Moon** button fixed in the bottom-right corner.
- Preference is persisted in `localStorage` and defaults to the OS system preference on first load.

### Service Logos
- Upload a PNG/JPG/SVG logo when creating a service.
- Stored in Catalyst Stratus object storage and displayed on service and task cards.
- Logos are auto-deleted from Stratus when the service is deleted.

## Stratus Object Storage

- **Bucket:** `taskmanager-175003` (public read)
- **Logo path:** `service-logos/<timestamp>-<filename>`
- Upload flow: frontend requests a presigned PUT URL from `task_api` → browser PUTs the file directly to Stratus → the returned object URL is saved in Datastore.
- Logos are auto-deleted from Stratus when the service is deleted.

---

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- pnpm (`npm i -g pnpm`)
- Catalyst CLI (`npm i -g @zohotools/catalyst`)

### Frontend
```bash
cd task-app-source
pnpm install
pnpm dev       # starts Vite dev server with proxy to Catalyst function
```

### Deploy to Catalyst
```bash
# Build frontend
cd task-app-source
pnpm build

# Deploy Slate (frontend) + API function
cd ..
catalyst deploy --only functions:task_api,slate:task-manager

# Deploy only frontend
catalyst deploy --only slate:task-manager

# Deploy only backend
catalyst deploy --only functions:task_api
```

### Environment Variables (set on `task_reminder` function in Catalyst Console)
| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` | Sender email address for reminders |
| `MAIL_TO` | Fallback recipient if task has no reminder_email |

## Built with Catalyst MCP

This project was developed end-to-end using the **[Catalyst MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server](https://github.com/zoho/catalyst-mcp)** — a tool that exposes Catalyst platform capabilities as structured tools an AI agent can invoke directly from the editor, without switching to the Catalyst Console or writing boilerplate setup code.

### What the MCP Server enabled

| Capability | How it was used |
|---|---|
| **DataStore operations** | Created and modified `Services` and `Tasks` tables; added columns (`is_pipeline`, `pipeline_reason`, `final_thoughts`, `is_priority`); updated column constraints (nullable `due_date`, `days_assigned`) |
| **Function management** | Inspected function configs, environment variables, and deployment status for `task_api` and `task_reminder` |
| **Cron / Job Scheduling** | Created, verified, and managed one-time cron jobs for task reminders during development |
| **Stratus object storage** | Verified bucket config, object paths, and presigned URL behaviour for service logo uploads |
| **Query execution** | Ran ZCQL queries directly to inspect live data and validate schema changes |
| **Project introspection** | Explored project config, resource IDs, and service metadata without leaving the editor |

### Why it mattered

Rather than context-switching between editor, Catalyst Console, and documentation, the MCP server let the AI agent query live platform state, apply schema changes, and validate behaviour — all within a single conversation. This meant features like Pipeline, Priority, and Final Thoughts (each requiring new DataStore columns and backend logic) could be designed, implemented, and verified in one continuous flow.
